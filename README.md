 <h1>About</h1>
One of the most common reasons for returns on e-commerce websites is the disparity between displayed and delivered product. Well, that won't be the case with ATLiAR. 

ATLiAR is a service for existing e-commerce websites that lets you browse items in Augmented Reality.
  
Users can skip through the worrying phase of whether or not a 
product will be 'as it is in the picture'. It's a surefire way of ensuring
that customers get exactly what they ordered. 
Merchants can use our application to generate and upload AR-Enabled 3D models of their product.

<h1>How it works?</h1>
As of now, we use Apple's RealityKit for photogrammetry to make 3D models out of scanned images.
We'll be using the Apple ARKit to display the items.
